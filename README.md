# Why there are commits from before today

I have already been personally using Git to backup my code for all the previous labs.

I've added the GitHub Classroom repo as a second remote on my machine, and since it is a new repo,
there are no conflicts with what I've already done and all the old commits were able to be pushed to the new remote no problem.

In past programming courses, we started using GitHub Classroom very early on so I never ended up creating any personal repos,
but now that I've started doing it here I've enjoyed having all my code stored safely in my own server, so I may continue that.

In any case, for future assignments the GitHub Classroom repo will always be the "origin" remote,
and I will not hesitate to remove my backup remote if any strange VCS problems crop up.
